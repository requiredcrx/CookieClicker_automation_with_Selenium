## About

Cookie Clicker Bot is an automation script written in Python using Selenium WebDriver to play the popular cookie-clicking game, Cookie Clicker. The script clicks on the cookie to earn cookies and automatically purchases upgrades when there's enough money. It's a fun way to boost your cookie production and reach high scores effortlessly!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- Safari Web Browser (Note: The script can be modified to work with other browsers)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/requiredcrx/cookie-clicker-bot.git
```
- Install the required dependencies:

## Customize

If you wish to customize the behavior of the bot, you can modify the purchase_times dictionary in the cookie_clicker_bot.py file. This dictionary specifies the delay (in seconds) for each upgrade check. Feel free to add or remove upgrades or adjust the timings to suit your preferences.
